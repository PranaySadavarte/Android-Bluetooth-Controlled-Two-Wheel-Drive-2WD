# Android-Bluetooth-Controlled-Two-Wheel-Drive-2WD
•	A two-wheel drive was designed using Arduino Uno R3 and an Adafruit Motor Driver. The vehicle was designed in such a way that it could be controlled by an android phone via Bluetooth.
•	A Bluetooth sensor (HC-06) was used to receive the instructions from the android phone.
•	 Two TT motors were used which were controlled by the Adafruit motor driver shield using AFMotor libraries in the Arduino IDE.
•	The controls included a forward, reverse, left and right button to control the device. A portable power source is connected to the chassis to make the project portable and convenient.
